            "description": "The [mobile app #OstaniZdrav](https://www.gov.si/en/ostanizdrav) reduces the spread of infections with the the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus by notifying the user that they have been in contact with a person with a confirmed infection. **One of the key attributes of the app is protecting the users’ anonymity and the decentralised processing of their data.** This means no one—not even the MPA and NIPH—can access data on individual users’ contacts or information on whether a user has a confirmed infection.\n\nBecause of these constraints [our analysis of the app's performance](#published-chart) is based solely on the data that can be accessed by the apps themselves. In order to interpret the charts below it is important to understand how the app works, and the meaning of terms such as daily keys, transmission risk levels, and the difference between published and valid keys.\n\nEvery day the app is installed on your phone it generates a random, unique and anonymous key. This daily key is used by the app to broadcast identifying codes to other phones in the vicinity that have the app installed . At the same time the app is receiving and saving the identifying codes of other nearby phones. When a user tests positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus they enter the teleTAN confirmation code into the app. This action uploads their daily keys for the last 14 days to the server, as this is the period when contacts are most risky.\n\nEvery day the app downloads the newly published daily keys from the server and checks if any of them correspond to the saved identifying codes of the phones you were exposed to. Additionally it knows how long and how close these contacts were, as well as the transmission risk levels for each day. The 14 daily keys have different transmission risk levels relative to the day the confirmation code was entered: they risk is lowest 14 days ago and then increases, with the highest levels reached on days two, three, and four before the positive test was entered. The app then uses these three factors to calculate if the exposure risk was high enough to notify you. \n\nThe transmission risk levels range from 1 (lowest) to 8 (highest). If the user had the app installed and working this whole period, the keys are attached the following sequence of risk levels: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 5 8 8 8 6 5. The server immediately publishes the first 13 keys, while the last one, which is valid for today, is published the next day to ensure greater anonymity. If the user didn't have the app installed from the beginning of this period, or turned it off in between, the sequence will have missing keys. On average sequences have around three missing keys. \n\n**In order to ensure the users' anonymity it is impossible to ascertain which keys belong to a single user. But because we know the typical sequence of the associated transmission risk levels, we can reconstruct sequences which correspond to the number of users with a high degree of accuracy. We cannot be sure the number is exactly correct, our estimate is just a very educated guess.**\n\nEvery day the server publishes a number of daily keys, and their associated transmission risk levels, which are valid for the previous 13 days. This is the data that the apps have access to, and this is also the data that is used in our analysis here.\n\n**Warning: Data for the current day is not necessarily complete.**",

            "answer": "Unfortunately, this data is unavailable for now. There are several reasons: Previously, tests have only covered a certain proportion of the population (patients with signs and symptoms of acute respiratory infection who may need hospital treatment, healthcare professionals, retirement home residents with respiratory symptoms, and people above 60 if their doctor so requires). Even though now the testing guidance for COVID-19 is expanded to include anyone displaying symptoms of the disease, many might be carriers with no or only mild symptoms. For this reason, our statistics can cover only part of the population that clearly shows signs of infection. Thus, the younger and the untested populations are disproportionately represented. Data for asymptomatic patients who do not show symptoms and are not recorded anywhere can therefore not be obtained."

            "answer": "Sledilnik used to rely on official sources (Government of the Republic of Slovenia, media) for the number of cured people. Unfortunately, reports on when a person is totally cured from Covid-19 are scarce – for now, we only have few confirmed reports of \"cured patients\", and there is, as of yet, still no official definition of when a particular person is cured. A [COVID-19 national survey](https://covid19.biolab.si/) is currently underway at the *Institute of Microbiology and Immunology*, which will also, through voluntary sample testing, show how many people have already fallen ill and recovered from COVID-19. As it is not yet known what the potential consequences of COVID-19 could be (various studies are addressing this question and the results will not be known for a long time), and because health institutions are also talking about recovered rather than cured patients, we are thus changing both the terminology and the method of calculating the number of recoveries. See also [Do you keep an Active Case counter and do you know how many people are currently infected?](#data-active-cases))\n\nOn April 14, the Department of Health released [Priporočila za zaključek izolacije in vrnitev na delovno mesto (Recommendations for Discontinuing Isolation and Returning to Work)](https://www.zbornica-zveza.si/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PRIPORO%C4%8CILO-Zaklju%C4%8Dek-izolacije-in-vrnitev-na-delovna-mesta-po-preboleli-bolezni-COVID-19.pdf) from which we can deduce when a person has recovered from the disease and can return to work. For people with symptoms, this is 14 days after the symptoms have subsided, and for healthcare professionals, a control swab is required after 14 days, which must be negative 2x in a row. The Government of the Republic of Slovenia regularly reports on discharges from the hospital, but we do not know if they have already recovered from the disease. The published recommendations indicate that these patients require two consecutive negative control swabs after discharge to home care in order to be considered able to return to work. [In its report](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19-rapid-risk-assessment-coronavirus-disease-2019-ninth-update-23-april-2020.pdf) the ECDC stated that *The 14-day incidence of reported COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK, providing an estimate of the prevalence of active cases in the population…* – so we chose the 14-day period as the time when the average confirmed case can still be counted as an *active case*.\n\nWe noticed that the [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) was reporting recovery numbers, but unfortunately we were unable to obtain data on where this information was coming from. Also, some other sources simply combine survivors with the number of discharged patients from hospitals. Since we believe that these two categories are interchangeable, we have decided to present them separately; these are the *Discharged from Hospital* and *Recovered* indicators.\n\n*Note: The calculation of recoveries was changed on 9 May 2020. We now consider a patient has recovered in 14 days after their infection was confirmed (previously 21 days), so there was be a noticeable jump in the number of survivors. Please take this difference into account when estimating the number of survivors. A more detailed explanation of the changed calculation is available in the Medium article [Od potrjeno okuženih do prebolelih (From Confirmed Case to Recovery )](https://medium.com/@sledilnik/94c81674718e).*"

The value of the active cases is calculated by simply subtracting the official data for the relevant category, the value of the Recovered (total) reflects the status of all confirmed cases three weeks ago (minus the dead). The number of recoveries is a simple estimate based on the value of all those confirmed infected in the past – based on the assumption that patients recover from the disease on average within 14 days (source: [the ECDC Report](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19-rapid-risk-assessment-coronavirus-disease-2019-ninth-update-23-april-2020.pdf)); thus, the number of recoveries on a given day equals the number of all confirmed cases three weeks prior to a given date, from which the number of deaths by that day is deducted. This simplified estimation does not take into account the more serious cases of COVID-19 with longer recovery times.\n\n*Note: The calculation of recoveries was changed on 9 May 2020.

Some people may be recorded several times, first by telephone and then during the examination.

If we select the *Total* or *Relative* display, we will jump from the confirmed cases curve to the histogram, which shows the number of confirmed infected persons within each category on a given day.\n\nThe increase in infected healthcare workers does not mean that they were discovered exactly on that day; they may have been positive before but information on their status was obtained subsequently. The *Retirement Home Employees* category includes healthcare workers, associates, and external assistance (health students), so the daily data on healthcare workers (blue curve or columns) are reduced accordingly. This means that the number of health professionals is a very conservative estimate."

            "answer": "The [graph](/en/stats#spread-chart) tells us how many new confirmed cases of infections there were on a given day, where the WHO and the [ECDC definition](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/case-definition-and-european-surveillance-human-infection-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov) that confirmed cases are “persons with a lab confirmation of infection with COVID19” is followed. From 21.12.2020 this includes cases confirmed with rapid antigen tests (RAT). As the number of confirmed cases still depends on testing, the data in confirmed cases is estimated to be much smaller that the actual number of infected people."

            "answer": "The [map](/en/stats#map-chart) shows us the epidemiological picture of individual municipalities, as it allows the display of *Confirmed Cases* (red shades) or the *Dead* (gray shades). When showing confirmed cases, we can see which municipalities are the most \"healthy\" (white) and which are currently the more \"infected\" (red shades) – if new cases are still appearing or not - and relative to the share of the population (Proportion of population is the default display). On the left, we can use the filter (1, 7, 14 or 21 days) to determine for what period of time we view data on new confirmed cases or deaths. For those municipalities where new cases are still being confirmed, we can conclude that the epidemic is still active. (Of course, this does not necessarily mean that the virus is not present in municipalities without new confirmed cases, but it is an indicator of the \"health\" of a certain area.) More details are available in the Medium article [Kje so “zdrave” občine? (Where Are the ‘Healthy’ Municipalities?)](https://medium.com/sledilnik/kje-so-zdrave-občine-613afc42b023)\n\nBy clicking on *Absolute* in the upper right corner, we can change the display and see the total number of newly confirmed cases or deaths in a selected time frame (1, 7, 14 or 21 days) in municipalities according to how they are painted."

        "municipalities-chart": {
            "question": "What does the chart “Cases by Municipalities” show us?",
            "answer": "The [chart](/en/stats#municipalities-chart) shows individual municipalities in columns in more detail with the number of confirmed cases by days, with active cases, recoveries (assessment) and deaths in each municipality. Below the municipality you can find the information about the time since the last confirmed case. Municipalities are classified according to when the last confirmed case was recorded there, from which we can conclude which municipalities are currently more “infected” and which are “healthier” than others.\n\nThe display can be changed by selecting different views above the graph: if you select the *Active* display, the municipalities will be sorted according to the current assessment of active cases; or if you select *All*, then the municipalities will be arranged by the largest total number of confirmed cases. If you choose *All Regions* from the dropdown menu, then confirmed cases will be shown in the municipalities belonging to that region. You can also easily search for a municipality by entering its name in the *Find Municipality* browser.\n\n*Note: the assessment of recoveries and active cases is done 14 days after the infection was confirmed, if and when the disease is in its mild form. However, if an individual is hospitalized, this recovery will last longer, but in this case the individual is not dangerous to the environment because he is in hospital. Since we do not take into account the hospitalized in the municipality presentation, it is possible that the sum of active cases by municipality does not match the estimate of the active cases for the whole country.

        "phase-diagram-chart": {
            "question": "What does the \"Phase diagram\" graph mean?",
            "answer": "[Phase diagram](/sl/stats#phase-diagram-chart) is a visualization which shows the state of the epidemic in a coordinate space that does not have time as one of its axis; axes are used for quantities that help visualize and compare the state of the epidemic regardless of the time at which this state was reached. The position of a point in such a visualization changes with time, typically following predictable patterns; this can help us understand the dynamics and decipher the phase of the epidemic. The diagram has two displays: \"Total vs. week\" and \"Incidence growth\".\n\n**Total vs. weekly** shows the total number of cases on the x axis, and new cases in the last week on the y axis. Both axes are logarithmic. When an epidemic grows exponentially, the point on this diagram will move upwards and to the right in a straight line; the faster the exponential growth, the steeper the slope of this line. When the growth slows down, the point first starts moving horizontally (a longer period of such dynamics would mean a plateau - linear growth of new cases), and with strong deceleration of the epidemic the curve turns sharply downwards and stops when the epidemic completes.\n\n**Incidence growth** shows the state of the epidemic using 7-day incidence on the x axis and its relative weekly growth on the y axis. Horizontal position of the point shows the spread of the virus in the population, while vertical position is related to the speed of the epidemic's exponential growth. When the point is above 100% vertically, the epidemic is growing exponentially and the point will move towards the right (incidence will increase). When the point is below 100%, the epidemic is dying out, and the point will move towards the left."

For example, the total number of tests represents the number of tests performed to date, but does not reflect the total number of people tested, as some people, such as healthcare professionals and people suspected of being infected, have been repeatedly tested.\n\nHowever, the number of confirmed cases depends solely on testing. Since the majority of infected people, who have mild or no symptoms, have not been tested for COVID-19 at all, the number of confirmed cases is significantly lower than the actual number of infected people (from 21.12.2020 people testing positive on rapid antigen tests (RAT) also count as confirmed cases)."
