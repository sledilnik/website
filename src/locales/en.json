            "description": "The [mobile app #OstaniZdrav](https://www.gov.si/en/ostanizdrav) reduces the spread of infections with the the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus by notifying the user that they have been in contact with a person with a confirmed infection. **One of the key attributes of the app is protecting the users‚Äô anonymity and the decentralised processing of their data.** This means no one‚Äînot even the MPA and NIPH‚Äîcan access data on individual users‚Äô contacts or information on whether a user has a confirmed infection.\n\nBecause of these constraints [our analysis of the app's performance](#published-chart) is based solely on the data that can be accessed by the apps themselves. In order to interpret the charts below it is important to understand how the app works, and the meaning of terms such as daily keys, transmission risk levels, and the difference between published and valid keys.\n\nEvery day the app is installed on your phone it generates a random, unique and anonymous key. This daily key is used by the app to broadcast identifying codes to other phones in the vicinity that have the app installed . At the same time the app is receiving and saving the identifying codes of other nearby phones. When a user tests positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus they enter the teleTAN confirmation code into the app. This action uploads their daily keys for the last 14 days to the server, as this is the period when contacts are most risky.\n\nEvery day the app downloads the newly published daily keys from the server and checks if any of them correspond to the saved identifying codes of the phones you were exposed to. Additionally it knows how long and how close these contacts were, as well as the transmission risk levels for each day. The 14 daily keys have different transmission risk levels relative to the day the confirmation code was entered: they risk is lowest 14 days ago and then increases, with the highest levels reached on days two, three, and four before the positive test was entered. The app then uses these three factors to calculate if the exposure risk was high enough to notify you. \n\nThe transmission risk levels range from 1 (lowest) to 8 (highest). If the user had the app installed and working this whole period, the keys are attached the following sequence of risk levels: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 5 8 8 8 6 5. The server immediately publishes the first 13 keys, while the last one, which is valid for today, is published the next day to ensure greater anonymity. If the user didn't have the app installed from the beginning of this period, or turned it off in between, the sequence will have missing keys. On average sequences have around three missing keys. \n\n**In order to ensure the users' anonymity it is impossible to ascertain which keys belong to a single user. But because we know the typical sequence of the associated transmission risk levels, we can reconstruct sequences which correspond to the number of users with a high degree of accuracy. We cannot be sure the number is exactly correct, our estimate is just a very educated guess.**\n\nEvery day the server publishes a number of daily keys, and their associated transmission risk levels, which are valid for the previous 13 days. This is the data that the apps have access to, and this is also the data that is used in our analysis here.\n\n**Warning: Data for the current day is not necessarily complete.**",
