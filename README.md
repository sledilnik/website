## Deployment

Overview of current [deployments](https://github.com/sledilnik/website/deployments)

Deployment is done using GitHub actions in `.github/workflows`

| file           | about                                             |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| prod.yml       | Deploy producition when GitHub release is created |
| stage.yml      | Deploy staging on every commit pushed to `master` |
| pr.yml         | Deploy PRs with label `deploy-peview`             |
| pr-cleanup.yml | Undeploy PRs when label is removed or PR closed   |

Actions consist mostly of 3 jobs, `test`, `build` and `deploy`. Each job depends on previous job (`needs` keyword in action's YAML).
When deploy job finishes, it also sends Slack notification to #devops chanel, and adds comment on PR (if PR build)

### Production

[Production environment](https://github.com/sledilnik/website/deployments/activity_log?environment=production) is deployed every time a new GitHub release is created.

Workflow `.github/workflows/prod.yml` is responsible for deployment.

### Staging

[Staging environment](https://github.com/sledilnik/website/deployments/activity_log?environment=staging) is deployed on every push to `master` (if tests pass and build is successful).

Workflow `.github/workflows/stage.yml` is responsible for deployment.

Use `NOBUILD` keyworkd in commit message to skip build (and deploy) for this commit (tests will still be ran). Use `NODEPLOY` keyworkd in commit message to skip deploy for this commit (image will still be build and pushed). 


### Preview deployment (pull requests)

Create PR from a branch (in this repo, not fork) to master. Label PR with label `deploy-preview` and wait few minutes. Deployment should be available at https://pr-NUM.preview.sledilnik.org where NUM is number of your PR.

Only open PR with label `deploy-preview` are deployed. When PR is closed or label removed, deployment is stopped.

## Development

## What you need

* yarn
* node
* .net core https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
* probably something I forgot

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn run build
```

### Run your tests

Not really that we have any tests

```
yarn run test
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn run lint
```

### FSharpLint

[FSharpLint](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharpLint) is used to check the
F# code. In order to use it, you need to run `build.bat` script, which will
1. install FSharpLint locally (if it was not already installed), 
1. run it on the source code,
1. run F# unit tests.

The configuration is stored in the `fsharplint-config.json` file. You can
find more information on how to configure or suppress various rules
[here](https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharpLint/how-tos/rule-configuration.html).

#### Using FSharpLint in Rider

If you use JetBrains Rider as your IDE, you can integrate FSharpLint into 
your workflow inside IDE by following these steps:

1. Make sure you have FSharpLint installed (see the above section).
1. Click `File` | `Settings` menu option.
1. In the Settings window, find `Tools`/`External Tools` tree item.
1. Press on the plus (`+`) button to add a new external tool.
1. In the `Edit Tool` window, enter the following values:
    - `Name`: `FSharpLint`
    - `Program`: `dotnet`
    - `Arguments`: `fsharplint --format msbuild lint -l fsharplint-config.json SloCovid19Website.sln`
    - `Advanced Options`: check all checkboxes
    - `Output filters`: `$FILE_PATH$\($LINE$\,$COLUMN$\,.*`
1. Press `OK` button to confirm.

Now you should have a new menu item under `Tools` | `External Tools` 
| `FSharpLint`.
