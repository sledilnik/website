## Deployment

https://travis-ci.com/github/sledilnik/website

Every push to `master` is automatically deployed (if build successfull) to https://covid-19.sledilnik.org

## Preview deployment

Create PR from a branch (in this repo, not fork) to master. Label PR with label `deploy-preview` and wait few minutes. Deployment should be available at https://pr-NUM.sledilnik.org where NUM is number of your PR.

Only open PR with label `deploy-preview` are deployed. When PR is closed or label removed, deployment is stopped.

## Development

## What you need

* yarn
* node
* .net core https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
* probably something I forgot

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn run build
```

### Run your tests

Not really that we have any tests

```
yarn run test
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn run lint
```

### FSharpLint

[FSharpLint](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharpLint) is used to check the
F# code. In order to use it, you need to run `build.bat` script, which will
1. install FSharpLint locally (if it was not already installed), 
1. run it on the source code,
1. run F# unit tests.

The configuration is stored in the `fsharplint-config.json` file. You can
find more information on how to configure or suppress various rules
[here](https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharpLint/how-tos/rule-configuration.html).

#### Using FSharpLint in Rider

If you use JetBrains Rider as your IDE, you can integrate FSharpLint into 
your workflow inside IDE by following these steps:

1. Make sure you have FSharpLint installed (see the above section).
1. Click `File` | `Settings` menu option.
1. In the Settings window, find `Tools`/`External Tools` tree item.
1. Press on the plus (`+`) button to add a new external tool.
1. In the `Edit Tool` window, enter the following values:
    - `Name`: `FSharpLint`
    - `Program`: `dotnet`
    - `Arguments`: `fsharplint --format msbuild lint -l fsharplint-config.json SloCovid19Website.sln`
    - `Advanced Options`: check all checkboxes
    - `Output filters`: `$FILE_PATH$\($LINE$\,$COLUMN$\,.*`
1. Press `OK` button to confirm.

Now you should have a new menu item under `Tools` | `External Tools` 
| `FSharpLint`.
